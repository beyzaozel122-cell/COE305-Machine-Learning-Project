# COE305 – Machine Learning Project
## Titanic Survival Prediction

This repository contains the **Stage 3** implementation of the COE305 Machine Learning course project.

---

## Stage 1 – Problem Definition and Data Understanding
The objective of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster.
The target variable is **Survived**, which represents a binary classification problem.
The dataset includes demographic and travel-related features.

---

## Stage 2 – Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis
Raw and cleaned versions of the dataset are analyzed.
Missing values are handled, categorical variables are encoded, and exploratory
data analysis is performed to understand feature distributions and relationships.

---

## Stage 3 – Model Training and Evaluation
Multiple machine learning models are trained and evaluated:

- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Random Forest  

Model performance is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

---

## Dataset
The dataset is obtained from the Kaggle Titanic Dataset.
